          In preparation for the Tokyo Olympics, the city of Tokyo is full of
          many foreign tourists. In addition, the signboards in English have
          become more prominent enough to create the illusion of being in a
          foreign country for a moment. However, when foreign tourists try to
          enjoy Tokyo, it seems that they often feel inconvenient because there
          is not enough explanation in English. Some people use the wrong
          English.

          There are a lot of things that foreigners want to experience in Japan,
          such as delicious food, wonderful culture and art. However, it is
          unfortunate that we are not able to convey them because of the
          language barrier. When a foreigner goes to the museum, it's almost
          finished. This is because there are few explanations in English.
          Ordering at a restaurant takes an eternal time. Because the menu
          cannot be read. We would like to help you to avoid this inconvenience
          with our translation service.

          We translate native English based on world standards. Rather than
          simply replacing one language with another, we strive to provide the
          best translations on the spot. Since translation is done in-house
          without outsourcing, I think we can provide a service close to the
          customer.

        <p>
          Needless to say, we also provide general translation services. Please
          contact us if you have any problems in English. Estimates are free and
          secure postpaid.
